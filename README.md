### Store Refill

This is a small app that shows a UI that monitors a modern store, in
which products are filled into lockers by an employee.

The employee can modify the state of each locker in the app while
changing the products in the lockers in the real world.

An admin (store owner or support) can monitor the state of the store
24/7. In later versions more features can be added like analytics,
save/load store setups etc
